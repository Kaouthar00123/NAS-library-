## Description

This tool is a NAS (Neural Architecture Search) library designed with a modular structure. It is organized into the following components:

- Search space module
- Search strategy module
- Training module
- Evaluation module

The library offers predefined search space templates that are highly customizable:

- Block/Layer-based NAS Search-space model
- Cell-based NAS Search-space model
- Hierarchical NAS Search-space model

The DNN architectures generated from these spaces are represented as flexible recursive Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) of neural network (NN) operations.
